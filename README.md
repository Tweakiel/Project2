# Project2

## Description
A recipe sharing website is an online platform where users can create, share, and discover recipes. Users can create an account, browse through different categories of recipes, and save their favorite ones. They can also upload their own recipes, add photos and instructions, and interact with other users by leaving comments and ratings.

## User Story 
As a user of the recipe sharing website, I want to be able to create a profile and log in to the website so that I can save my favorite recipes and share my own recipes with others. I also want to be able to browse through different categories of recipes, search for specific recipes, and sort recipes based on different criteria such as popularity, rating, and cooking time. Additionally, I want to be able to view recipes with clear instructions, ingredients list, and photos. Finally, I want to be able to interact with other users by leaving comments, rating recipes, and sharing recipes on social media platforms.
